_NOTE:_ There is a link:https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#limits-for-secrets[limit of 100] secrets per repository, therefore the sync is split into multiple repos.

The deploy keys can be set by an organization owner via the python script link:configure_deploy_keys.py[configure_deploy_keys.py].

Do not forget `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the python script.
