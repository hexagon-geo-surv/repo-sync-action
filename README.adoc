= Repo Sync

Keep forks and mirrors up-to-date.

The configuration of which forks/mirrors are synced is done in link:.github/workflows/main.yml[.github/workflows/main.yml].

The deploy keys can be set by an organization owner via the python script link:configure_deploy_keys.py[configure_deploy_keys.py].

Do not forget `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the python script.
