= Repo Sync

GitHub action definition to keep forks and mirrors up-to-date.

The action itself is executed and configured in the following repositories:

- link:https://github.com/hexagon-geo-surv/repo-sync-workflow-application-core/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml[repo-sync-workflow-application-core]
- link:https://github.com/hexagon-geo-surv/repo-sync-workflow-application-qt-1/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml[repo-sync-workflow-application-qt-1]
- link:https://github.com/hexagon-geo-surv/repo-sync-workflow-application-qt-2/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml[repo-sync-workflow-application-qt-2]
- link:https://github.com/hexagon-geo-surv/repo-sync-workflow-bsp/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml[repo-sync-workflow-bsp]

*NOTE:* There is a link:https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#limits-for-secrets[limit of 100 secrets] per repository, therefore the sync is split into multiple repos.

*NOTE:* Due to link:https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/74[this issue], this repository needs to be public.

The deploy keys can be set by an organization owner via the python script link:configure_deploy_keys.py[configure_deploy_keys.py].

Do not forget `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the python script.
